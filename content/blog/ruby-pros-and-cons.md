- The performance is not as fast as on PHP or Javascript( lowest )
- As it’s the technology that pays really well, development might turn out to be more expensive than in other languages
- The MVP(minimum viable product) is dead, long life to the MAP. ([Minimum Awesome Product](https://medium.com/swlh/the-mvp-is-dead-long-life-to-the-map-minimum-awesome-product-404df90fef7f))
